# Submitted-source capture runs inside a kernel boundary

## Status and authority

Accepted for the Agents repository. Subordinate to ADR-0023, which made the
Compilation Service the only thing that turns submitted source into an artifact
and made Python `apxm_program` and TypeScript `@apxm/frontend` the complete
authoring set. This record does not reopen that decision, the capture
translation, or the closed source-diagnostic vocabulary. It states what the
kernel confines a capture child to, and the one operator flag that answers a
kernel which cannot provide it.

## Context

Capturing typed intent from submitted source runs an authoring frontend, and
both frontends resolve an authored callback through their language's module
system, so the submitted text is evaluated. The evaluation has been confined
from inside the interpreter: the Python harness runs an isolated interpreter
behind an audit hook that rejects process, network, dynamic-code and filesystem
events, with a zero file-size limit, a CPU limit, an address-space limit and a
zero-process limit; the TypeScript harness runs under Node's permission model,
which grants read of one package root and no write at all.

That is one wall, and it is the wall a submitted program is best placed to
attack. It is written in the language the attacker controls, it depends on the
interpreter emitting an audit event for every reachable operation, and on the
TypeScript side it bounds neither CPU time nor memory. A hosted deployment that
accepts third-party source needs the operating system to answer as well, so that
a hole in an interpreter reaches a second closed door rather than the host.

## Decision

**Every capture child runs inside a kernel boundary, applied by the source port
before the interpreter execs.** On Linux the boundary is three things:

1. **A Landlock ruleset.** The child may read and execute the authoring frontend
   package root, the declared interpreter driver and the driver's own runtime
   prefix, and the shared-library roots the interpreter links against; it may
   read the architecture-independent runtime data beside them, `/proc`, the
   loader cache, the local time zone, and the random and null devices. It may
   read, write and create inside exactly one per-capture scratch directory,
   which the port creates, names to the child as `TMPDIR`, and removes when the
   capture ends. Everything else is denied by the kernel: `/etc/passwd`, the
   home directories, the artifact directory, the rest of the checkout.
   Executable rights stop at the library roots, so no system command is
   executable inside the boundary and a submitted program cannot exec a shell
   even where it can name one.

2. **A seccomp filter.** Every socket domain but `AF_UNIX` is refused with
   `EPERM`, so the network is closed whichever interpreter is running and
   whether or not that interpreter emits an audit event. A new process is
   refused however the child asks for one — `fork`, `vfork`, and any `clone`
   that is not creating a thread — while thread creation, which both
   interpreters need, is allowed; that holds whatever user the service runs as,
   which a process ceiling alone does not. Tracing, namespace, mount, module
   and key-management calls are refused outright. `no_new_privs` is set, so
   nothing the child execs can regain privilege.

3. **Resource ceilings.** CPU time, writable data, produced file size, core
   dumps and the number of tasks the child may hold are bounded. The CPU ceiling
   is below the port's own wall-clock capture timeout, so a program that only
   spins is ended by the kernel rather than by the supervising thread. The
   TypeScript bridge additionally carries Node's own old-space ceiling on its
   command line, because Node has no interpreter resource limits of its own and
   that ceiling therefore holds on every host. Each ceiling is clamped to the
   hard limit the service already holds, because a child that is not privileged
   cannot raise one and a ceiling stated above the host's would be refused
   outright and take the capture with it.

   **`RLIMIT_NPROC` counts threads, so it is a thread budget and not a fork
   refusal.** On Linux a thread is a task and every task is charged to the same
   ceiling, so a ceiling of zero refuses the first `pthread_create` as surely as
   the first `fork`: Node's V8 platform threads and libuv pool never start and
   the bridge dies inside the interpreter before it reads a request. The ceiling
   is therefore set high enough for both bridges and low enough to bound a
   program that only creates threads, and refusing a new process is left
   entirely to the filter in (2), which is the refusal that holds whatever user
   the service runs as.

The interpreter-level confinement stays exactly as it is. It is the inner wall,
it is tighter than the kernel boundary in the places it can be, and neither wall
is relaxed because the other exists.

### The operator flag

`APXM_CAPTURE_CONFINEMENT` selects how a kernel that cannot provide the boundary
is answered.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| unset, or anything but `permissive` | `enforce`. A Linux host without Landlock or without seccomp filtering refuses every capture with `frontend_unavailable`. |
| `permissive` | Development only. Apply whatever the kernel offers and capture anyway. |

`APXM_CAPTURE_SCRATCH_DIR` is the second flag, and it is a deployment input
rather than a mode: it names the writable root described below. Unset, the
platform temporary directory is used, which is what a development host has.

A typo is `enforce`, so no misspelling opens the boundary. The Compilation
Service prints its capture-confinement readiness to standard error before it
serves its first request — the boundary identifier, the host, the mode, the
status, the Landlock ABI the kernel reported, and one sentence an operator can
act on — so a deployment onto a kernel without Landlock is visible at start
rather than at the first refused compile.

### The one writable path, and the container it runs in

The scratch directory is the only path capture may write, so capture cannot
start where that directory cannot be created. A service container normally runs
with a read-only root filesystem, which makes the platform temporary directory
unwritable, and the first compile then answers `frontend_unavailable` for a
reason that has nothing to do with the submitted source.

**The root the per-capture directory is created under is an operating
requirement of the image, not of the consumer.** `APXM_CAPTURE_SCRATCH_DIR`
names that root; the Compilation Service image sets it to
`/var/lib/apxm/capture` and declares that path as a volume, so the mount is
writable while the layer beneath it is not and a `--read-only` container
compiles with nothing mounted by its consumer. The port creates the root when it
is absent, so a mount that arrives empty needs no operator step. An operator who
would rather keep scratch in memory mounts a tmpfs on the same path
(`--tmpfs /var/lib/apxm/capture`), which needs no image change. A root that
cannot hold a directory is refused with `frontend_unavailable` naming the root
and this flag, and readiness reports the root and its writability before the
first request, so the mistake is visible at start.

### A host that is not Linux

macOS provides no Landlock ruleset and no seccomp filter. There the boundary is
a **documented no-op**: capture runs behind the interpreter-level confinement
alone, and readiness reports `unsupported_platform` with that sentence in it. A
development laptop is not a deployment target, and there is nothing for the
`enforce` mode to fail closed against, so `enforce` does not refuse capture
there. The conformance for the boundary is Linux conformance and runs on Linux.

## Consequences

* A hostile program that reaches for `/etc/passwd`, opens an internet socket,
  execs a system binary, forks a shell, allocates without bound, or spins is
  refused by the kernel and the capture ends in one closed source diagnostic —
  `source_rejected` where the interpreter reports the refusal, and
  `frontend_unavailable` where the kernel ended the child before it could
  report anything. Neither produces a graph, and neither produces an artifact.
* The boundary is built in the parent and entered by the child before exec, so
  the pre-exec step allocates nothing and makes only the calls that restrict it.
* A capture may write exactly one directory. A frontend that ever needs a
  temporary file has one, named the way an interpreter looks for one, and it
  disappears with the capture.
* Both bridges create the threads they need. A submitted program still cannot
  reach a new process by any route — `fork`, `vfork`, `posix_spawn`, `clone`
  without `CLONE_THREAD`, `clone3` — because that refusal moved entirely into
  the filter, where it was already stated and where it does not depend on the
  user the service runs as.
* The service image must run on a kernel with Landlock and seccomp, and must
  carry a writable mount at the scratch root it declares. Both are operating
  requirements of the image, and the image states both: the volume is declared
  in the Dockerfile and readiness reports the boundary and the root at start.
  That is the common case for a hosted deployment and the reason the flags exist
  for the cases it is not.
* Shipping this boundary changes the service binary, so it reaches a consumer
  only in the next cohort, with the release manifest and image labels re-cut
  from these bytes.
